# Project3

Public perception is that politics are more divisive than ever, but is this truly the case? 
Using election data by congressional districts, we aim to show geographically if districts 
that were more moderate in the past have been moving more to the extremes. We will be using 
leaflet to visualize the districts and show them as darker or lighter shades of red or blue. 
The user will be able to select different election years so see the changes.
